There are two parts of this project:
1. Analysis: BitterGCN model is trained and tested. The model is then used to get the graph embeddings and analyse them. 
    - Graph level analysis:
        - 2D representation (TSNE plot). 
        - Clustering using OPTICS clustering method. (found 4 clusters)
    - Node level details   
2. Cross Validation
